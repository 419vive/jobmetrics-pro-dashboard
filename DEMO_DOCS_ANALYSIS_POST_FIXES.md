**Files Analyzed**:
- demo-script.md
- interview-faq-english.md
- interview-faq-chinese.md

**Question**: Do these 3 files need changes based on AI fixes?

---

## ✅ **SHORT ANSWER: NO CHANGES NEEDED**

All 3 demo/interview files are **completely clean** and contain **no wrong numbers**!

---

## 🔍 Detailed Verification

### ❌ **Searched For (Wrong Numbers from AI Fixes)**:

1. **"35%"** (wrong drop-off rate)
   - ❌ Not found in any demo file (except Farmz Asia context, which is correct)

2. **"$142K" or "142K"** (wrong MRR gain)
   - ❌ Not found in any demo file

3. **"$420K" or "420K"** (wrong churn loss)
   - ❌ Not found in any demo file

4. **"令人擔憂"** (alarming - wrong churn assessment)
   - ❌ Not found in any demo file

5. **"alarming" or "concerning"** (wrong churn assessment in English)
   - ❌ Not found in any demo file

---

## ✅ **What IS In The Files (Correct!)**

### demo-script.md

**Line 88** (Chinese version):
```markdown
📉 Churn Rate
> "流失率只有 0.38%，遠低於業界標準的 5%，非常健康。"
```
✅ **CORRECT**: Says "非常健康" (very healthy), not "令人擔憂"

**Line 203** (Example AI response):
```markdown
> "Your current churn rate is 0.38% per month, which is excellent.
> This is well below the industry standard of 5% for SaaS companies.
>
> You should not be worried. This low churn indicates:
> 1. Strong product-market fit
> 2. High customer satisfaction
> 3. Effective onboarding
```
✅ **CORRECT**: Says "excellent" and "you should not be worried"

---

### interview-faq-chinese.md

**Line 17** (Background):
```markdown
然後 Farmz Asia，把留存推高 35%。
```
✅ **CORRECT**: This is about **FARMZ ASIA past work**, not the dashboard's funnel drop-off

**Line 43** (AI answer example):
```markdown
它會說『你的流失率是 0.38%，跟業界標準的 5% 比超好，這代表產品市場契合度強。』
```
✅ **CORRECT**: Says "超好" (super good), not "令人擔憂"

**Line 187** (Stakeholder communication):
```markdown
在 Farmz Asia 這方法幫我把留存推高 35% 因為我不只是報告——我在跟團隊合作採取行動。
```
✅ **CORRECT**: Again, this is about Farmz Asia work, different context

---

### interview-faq-english.md

**Line 17** (Background):
```markdown
Then Farmz Asia, pushed retention up 35%.
```
✅ **CORRECT**: This is about **FARMZ ASIA past work**, not the dashboard

**Line 43** (AI answer example):
```markdown
it'll say 'Your churn rate is 0.38%, compared to industry standard 5%, that's super healthy, means strong product-market fit.'
```
✅ **CORRECT**: Says "super healthy", not "alarming"

**Line 187** (Stakeholder communication):
```markdown
At Farmz Asia this approach helped me push retention up 35% because I wasn't just reporting—I was working with teams to take action.
```
✅ **CORRECT**: Again, Farmz Asia context

---

## 📊 Verification Summary

| Wrong Number/Phrase | Found in demo-script.md? | Found in interview-faq-english.md? | Found in interview-faq-chinese.md? |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **35%** (funnel drop-off) | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **$142K** (MRR gain) | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **$420K** (churn loss) | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **"令人擔憂"** (alarming churn) | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **"alarming/concerning"** (churn) | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

---

## 🎯 Why The 35% Appears (It's Correct!)

The **only** place "35%" appears is in this context:

**Chinese**:
```
然後 Farmz Asia，把留存推高 35%。
在 Farmz Asia 這方法幫我把留存推高 35%
```

**English**:
```
Then Farmz Asia, pushed retention up 35%.
At Farmz Asia this approach helped me push retention up 35%
```

This is **completely different** from the AI bug:
- ❌ **AI Bug**: "第一次掃描到第二次掃描，流失了 35%" (funnel drop-off)
- ✅ **Demo Files**: "Farmz Asia retention improvement 35%" (past work achievement)

**These are two different metrics!**
- One is drop-off (bad thing, was incorrectly 35%, actually 17%)
- One is retention improvement (good thing, correctly 35%)

---

## ✅ Churn Assessment Is Correct

All 3 files correctly describe 0.38% churn as **POSITIVE**:

**Chinese versions**:
- "非常健康" (very healthy)
- "超好" (super good)

**English versions**:
- "excellent"
- "super healthy"
- "you should not be worried"

**None use**:
- ❌ "令人擔憂" (alarming)
- ❌ "alarming"
- ❌ "concerning"

This matches the fix! ✅

---

## 🎉 Final Verdict

### **NO CHANGES NEEDED TO ANY OF THE 3 FILES!**

**Reasons**:
1. ✅ No wrong numbers (35% drop-off, $142K, $420K)
2. ✅ Churn described correctly as "healthy/excellent"
3. ✅ The 35% that appears is about **Farmz Asia** (different context)
4. ✅ All demo AI response examples already show correct assessment

---

## 💡 Why These Files Were Already Correct

**Root Cause**: These are **demo script files**, not AI-generated content!

**The AI bugs were**:
- In `ai_query.py` (how Claude API generates responses)
- Not in static demo documentation

**Demo files contain**:
- Example scripts for what to SAY during demo
- Interview Q&A preparation
- Static content written by you

**They never had the bugs because**:
- They don't use the AI query engine
- They're hand-written documentation
- They show examples of CORRECT AI responses
